# The Star Game Rules Summary

## Introduction

The Star Game is a complex, three-dimensional, seven-board abstract strategy game developed by David Myatt in 1975. It is primarily designed for "noetic" (intellectual, contemplative, symbolic) use rather than purely competitive play. It serves as an esoteric tool within the Order of Nine Angles (ONA) system, intended as an aid to gaining insight into hermeticism and the quest for *Lapis Philosophicus* (the Philosopher's Stone).

## Components

1.  **Boards:** Seven square boards, each composed of nine white and nine black squares (18 squares total per board, likely 3x6 or similar checkered pattern). They are arranged "in a spiral one above the other" and named after stars:
    * Naos (Top)
    * Deneb
    * Rigel
    * Mira
    * Antares
    * Arcturus
    * Sirius (Bottom)
2.  **Pieces:** Two sets (White and Black). Each player controls 27 pieces.
3.  **Piece Types:** The 27 pieces consist of three sets of nine unique types. These types are designated by symbols, which can be either combinations of Greek letters (α, β, γ) or alchemical sigils (Salt 🜔, Mercury ☿, Sulphur 🜍). The nine Greek letter combinations are:
    * α(α), α(β), α(γ)
    * β(α), β(β), β(γ)
    * γ(α), γ(β), γ(γ)
    *(Note: Pieces are often represented as cubes with different symbols on each face to track transformations).*

## Setup

Pieces are placed at the start of the game according to their type. The specific initial placements described use the Greek letter system:

* **Sirius:** Six `α` pieces per player (two sets of α(α), α(β), α(γ)), placed as shown in Figure 1 of the PDF.
* **Arcturus:** Three `α` pieces per player (one set of α(α), α(β), α(γ)), placed as shown in Figure 2 of the PDF.
* **Antares:** Six `β` pieces per player (two sets of β(α), β(β), β(γ)), placed in the same pattern as the `α` pieces on Sirius.
* **Mira:** No pieces start on this board.
* **Rigel:** Three `β` pieces per player (the remaining β(α), β(β), β(γ)), placed in the same pattern as the `α` pieces on Arcturus.
* **Deneb:** Six `γ` pieces per player (two sets of γ(α), γ(β), γ(γ)), placed in the same pattern as the `α` pieces on Sirius.
* **Naos:** Three `γ` pieces per player (the remaining γ(α), γ(β), γ(γ)), placed in the same pattern as the `α` pieces on Arcturus.

## Objective

The objective is flexible and decided by the players before the game begins.

* **Standard Objective:** To be the first player to place three specific pieces onto designated squares on the Mira board, forming a predetermined pattern. The exact pattern and piece types required are decided beforehand. An example pattern is shown in Figure 3 of the PDF.

## Gameplay

Players take turns moving one piece per turn.

### Core Mechanic: Transformation

* **Rule:** After a piece is moved (either across a board or between boards), it **transforms** into the next piece type according to a fixed sequence.
* **Greek Letter Sequence:**
    α(α) → α(β) → α(γ) → β(α) → β(β) → β(γ) → γ(α) → γ(β) → γ(γ) → α(α) (cycle repeats).
* **Effect:** The piece now follows the movement rules of its *new* type. For example, if an α(γ) piece moves, it becomes a β(α) piece and will subsequently move according to the rules for β pieces.

### Movement Rules (Greek Symbols)

Movement rules depend on the piece's *current* type:

1.  **α Pieces (α(α), α(β), α(γ)):** Can move **only across the board they are currently on** to any vacant square. They cannot move between boards.
2.  **β Pieces (β(α), β(β), β(γ)):** Can move across the board they are currently on to any vacant square. They can also move **up or down one level** to an adjacent board (e.g., from Arcturus up to Antares, or down to Sirius).
3.  **γ Pieces (γ(α), γ(β), γ(γ)):** Can move to **any vacant square on any of the seven boards**.

### Capture Rule

* Only a piece that is currently **γ(γ)** can capture.
* The γ(γ) piece can capture **any opposing piece** on **any square** on **any board**.
* The captured piece is removed from the game.
* **Important:** After capturing (which counts as its move), the γ(γ) piece transforms into α(α). As an α piece, its next move is restricted to moving only across the board it landed on.

### Mira Board Rule

* Pieces can only stay on the Mira board for a maximum of **three moves**.
* The count starts when a piece is placed on Mira. The player has three moves (including the move onto Mira, and the next two moves starting from Mira) before the piece **must** be moved off Mira or be forfeited.
* **Forfeiture:** If a piece cannot legally move off Mira after its three-move limit (specifically mentioned for an α(α) piece, which can only move across its current board), it is forfeited and removed from the game.

## Rule Variations

Players can agree on variations before starting:

1.  **Naos Capture Restriction:** Pieces on the Naos board cannot be captured by a γ(γ) piece. (This increases difficulty).
2.  **Mira Time Limit Waiver:** The three-move limit for pieces on the Mira board can be waived.

## Modes of Play

The game is generally used in two ways:

1.  **Solo Contemplative Meditation:** One person plays both sides (White vs. Black) with a predetermined objective, using the game as a tool for silent meditation and gaining insight.
2.  **Two-Player Game:** Played similarly to chess, with players alternating turns, aiming to achieve a predetermined objective.

## Esoteric Purpose

The game's symbolism, movement, and transformations are intended to enable the perception of connections beyond simple logic, aiding insight into hermeticism and the quest for *Lapis Philosophicus*. The game itself contains, in its symbolism and techniques, the esoteric wisdom of alchemy, magick, and the Occult, according to the Naos manuscript.
