# Rendering Reality

This document presents a model in which **form**, **reality**, **knowledge**, and **self** arise naturally from the existence of interaction itself.  
By paying attention to the forms that self-propagate, dynamic processes emerge as part of the exhaustive combinations of encounters that can occur.  
The same model applies at various levels of granularity and is fractal in nature — the same principles repeat at every scale.

## Encounter

An encounter is an interaction made knowable by a visible change.  
A visible change is one that produces another reaction.  
All is encounter — all structure, pattern, and stability arise from the web of these interactions.  
Each encounter itself arises from deeper encounters, with no ultimate bottom — only endless layers of interaction.

---

## Rendering

Rendering is the process through which encounters produce forms.  
Rendering shapes the granularity at which patterns are recognized.  
It is recursive and endless — forms render forms, which render further forms.  
To comprehend a form is itself an act of rendering: form rendering form.  

Rendering happens within what we call the system — it takes encounters and produces other encounters, stabilizing patterns that condition future interactions.

## Form

A form is a selection of encounter(s).  
It is what rendering identifies as a coherent pattern of interaction.

---

## Persistent Form

A persistent form is a form that produces itself, or produces a form that produces itself (eventually).  
It is a stabilized pattern of encounters:

- Persists through or after further encounters (can go away and come back)
- Stability is temporary, relative
- Can produce itself (immediately or after transitions)
- Can produce other forms

A form does not exist without rendering to see it — it exists only inside the larger forms it is part of.  
A form is defined at a particular granularity, which is set by rendering.

**Examples:**
- Every atom is a form
- An orbit is a form
- A planet is a form at low granularity

## Knowledge

Knowledge is a form.

- Any knowledge can represent any form by some mapping  
  - Mathematically: There exists a mapping *f* that relates encounters to any result  

- **Integration:**  
  Integration of encounters refers to changes to a form due to encounters.  
  Some integration creates a state change — a stable sub-form interpretable as knowledge.  
  Integration includes:
  - Rendering of interaction into knowledge
  - Stabilization of knowledge in usable form
  - Changes to future encounters due to this state  

- The usefulness of knowledge is how it affects the forms it is part of:
  - Helps continue replication or avoid non-replication  

- Knowledge is only as useful as:
  - The rendering process that creates it
  - The changes it causes to future encounters:
    - If you can’t reliably apply the knowledge to future input
    - If applying it doesn’t produce better replication than without

## Self

The self is a form — a stabilized impression of encounters.  
There is no separate self beyond form and encounter.

---

## Reality

Reality is the form of all forms.  
It is the total rendering of encounters at all levels.  
This structure is fractal — the same dynamics apply at every scale.  
There is no ultimate substrate — only endless rendering.

## Form Stability and Modeling of the Surrounding System

A form’s stability depends on how well it models the super-form — the larger form it exists within.  
To persist, a form must account for conditions and influences outside itself.  
Stability arises from successfully compressing external complexity into a usable model.

Persistence selects for forms that best model relevant threats, opportunities, and patterns:
- Defenses are inverse models of threats and missed opportunities
- Responses are models of opportunities and threats
- Survival of the fittest is survival of the fittest models and the fittest use of those models
