* * ## Game Ruleset: Final Recap
    
      ### 1. The Game Setup
    
      * **Boards:** 7 boards, stacked vertically, each 7x7 squares. Boards are numbered 1 (Bottom) to 7 (Top).
      * **Pieces:** 7 pieces per player (one set of White, one set of Black).

      ### 2. The Objective
    
      The first player to successfully complete the journey with **three** of their pieces wins the game.
    
      This winning move is achieved when a player's final-Phase piece completes its "Ascend" or "Descend" action from its final board.
    
      * **White (`King`):** Wins by successfully "Ascending" from **Board 7**.
      * **Black (`Queen`):** Wins by successfully "Descending" from **Board 1**.
    
      When a piece completes this final move, it is removed from the game.

      ### 3. The Asymmetrical Paths
    
      #### White Player
      * **Piece Path:** `Pawn` $\rightarrow$ `Rook` $\rightarrow$ `King`
      * **Start Board:** Board 1 (Bottom)
      * **Journey:** Moves **UP** the boards using the **"Ascend"** action.
    
      #### Black Player
      * **Piece Path:** `Pawn` $\rightarrow$ `Bishop` $\rightarrow$ `Queen`
      * **Start Board:** Board 7 (Top)
      * **Journey:** Moves **DOWN** the boards using the **"Descend"** action.

      ### 4. The "Move" Action (Movement & Interference)
    
      This is a 1-turn action to move a piece to a **vacant square**. "Move" actions are used for positioning, interference, or returning to the "path."
    
      #### On-Board "Move"
      Movement on a piece's *current* board.
      * `Pawn` (White): Moves 1 square **orthogonally**.
      * `Pawn` (Black): Moves 1 square **diagonally**.
      * `Rook` (White): Moves any number of squares **orthogonally**.
      * `Bishop` (Black): Moves any number of squares **diagonally**.
      * `King` (White) & `Queen` (Black): Both move any number of squares **orthogonally or diagonally**.
    
      #### Vertical "Move" (Board-Jumping)
      Movement *between* boards.
      * A piece's **"High Water Mark"** is the furthest board it has reached on its current journey.
      * A `Pawn` can "Move" **one board up or one board down**, but only to a board **up to (or at) its "High Water Mark."**
      * A `Rook`, `Bishop`, `King`, or `Queen` can "Move" by jumping vertically to any board **up to (or at) its "High Water Mark,"** moving in its normal fashion.

      ### 5. The "Ascend" / "Descend" Action (The Journey)
      
      This is the **2-turn action** required to move along the main path from one board to the next.
      
      #### The Action
      * **Turn 1:** Tap to begin "Ascend/Descend." The piece becomes **Tapped**.
      * **Turn 2:** The ascending piece takes no action and remains **Tapped**; you may **Move** a different piece normally.
      * **Turn 3:** If not "broken," the piece moves to its destination square on the next board.
    
      #### Prerequisites (Conditions for Starting)
      A piece can only "Begin Ascend/Descend" if *all* of the following are true:
      1.  It is on its **"High Water Mark" board.**
      2.  It is **not "Confused"** (see section 6).
      3.  It is **not "Paralyzed"** (see section 6).
      
      #### Disruption (How to "Break" the Action)
      This 2-turn action is "broken" if, during either of the two opponent turns while the piece is **Tapped**, any of the following occur:
      1.  **Safety Bubble Disruption:** An opponent "Moves" into the piece's "safety bubble" *on that same board*. This bubble is defined by the piece's movement pattern:
          * **`Pawn`:** Is disrupted if an opponent moves into its **1-square "bubble"** (ortho for White, diag for Black).
          * **`Rook` / `Bishop`:** Is disrupted if an opponent moves onto any square within its **"movement pattern"** (Rook-lines for White, Bishop-lines for Black).
      2.  **Destination Square Disruption:** An opponent "Moves" one of their pieces onto the **destination square** (the exact square the piece would land on) on the target board.
      * **`King` / `Queen` Exception:** The "Ascend/Descend" action for a `King` or `Queen` **cannot** be broken by the "Safety Bubble Disruption." It *can* still be broken by the "Destination Square Disruption."
      * **Final Move Exception:** The final "Ascend/Descend" that removes a `King` (from Board 7) or a `Queen` (from Board 1) from the game **cannot be broken in any way.**

      ### 6. Conflict & Cooperation (Indirect Rules)
    
      Conflict is indirect, focusing on two different states of paralysis.
    
      #### "Confused" (Cannot "Ascend/Descend")
      This is a state of distraction caused by an *equal or lower-Phase* opposing piece.
      * **Rule:** A piece is **"Confused"** if an **opposing piece of equal or lower Phase** is on a square within its "movement pattern" *on the same board*.
      * **Effect:** A **"Confused"** piece **can still "Move"** (including Vertical "Move" up to its **"High Water Mark"**), but it **cannot begin "Ascend/Descend."**
    
      #### "Paralyzed" (Cannot "Move" or "Ascend/Descend")
      This is a state of total paralysis caused by a *higher-Phase* opposing piece.
      * **Rule:** A piece is **"Paralyzed"** if an **opposing piece of a higher Phase** is on a square within its "movement pattern" *on the same board*.
      * **Effect:** A **"Paralyzed"** piece **cannot "Move" or "Ascend/Descend."** It is locked in place until the blocking piece moves away.
    
      #### "Mentorship" (Breaking Paralysis & Confusion)
      This is how friendly pieces cooperate to overcome these states.
      * **Rule:** A "Confused" or "Paralyzed" piece is *freed* (and can "Move" or "Ascend/Descend" normally) if there is a friendly **"Mentor"** piece **on any square within the piece's movement pattern (on the same board).**
      * **Condition:** The "Mentor" piece must be of the **same or higher Phase** than the **highest-Phase *blocking* piece.**
      * **Example:** A White `Pawn` is **"Paralyzed"** by a Black `Bishop` (Phase 2). A friendly White `Rook` (Phase 2) *can* act as a "Mentor" because it is the same Phase as the blocking piece.
      * **Edge Case:** If two same-Phase friendly pieces are within each other's movement pattern and both are **"Confused"** by a same-Phase opposing piece, either friendly piece may start "Ascend/Descend" due to mentorship. However, because you can only start one "Ascend/Descend" per turn, both cannot start at the same time; the other remains **"Confused"** until the board state changes.
