## 2. Overview and Objective
Confusion is an abstract strategy game played across seven 7x7 boards stacked in a column. Each player guides a set of asymmetric pieces along a path of transformation, attempting to complete three journeys before their opponent.

Objective: Be the first player to complete the journey with three of your pieces. A journey is completed when a final‑phase piece successfully performs its last Ascend/Descend off its end board (White King from Board 7; Black Queen from Board 1).

Name origin (exoteric): The game is named after the in‑game state Confused, which represents interference and distraction that shape decision‑making.

## 3. Start of Play
Distribute dice by side. Each player has a total pool of seven pieces for the entire game (including any King/Queen that later leave the boards). Decide first player by any fair method.

Board indices run bottom to top from 1 to 7. Files/columns are A–G, ranks/rows are 1–7; using coordinates is optional. Calling (announcing) a move aloud is good etiquette but not required.

## 4. Core Concepts
- Level: A piece’s level is the highest‑numbered board it has reached on its path. The die’s upward number shows the level. White begins at 1; Black begins at 7.
- Start Boards: White starts from Board 1 (journeys upward); Black starts from Board 7 (journeys downward).
- Phases and Paths: White pieces progress Pawn → Rook → King; Black pieces progress Pawn → Bishop → Queen.
- Per‑type Cap: You may have at most three pieces of a given type on the boards at any time.
- Total Pool: You have seven total pieces for the whole game; removed Kings/Queens still count toward this total.
- Assistance: Friendly assistance can free a piece from interference (see Influence States).


## 5. Turn Structure
On your turn, perform one of the following:

- Move
  - Placement Move (placing a Pawn): Place one of your Pawns on your Start Board (White: 1; Black: 7) on any vacant square of your color (White on white; Black on black), provided you currently have fewer than three Pawns on the boards and you have not exhausted your seven‑piece pool.
  - On‑board Move: Move a piece on its current board per its movement pattern to a vacant square (see Movement and Range Reference).
  - Vertical Move (board‑jumping): Move a piece to another board up to (and including) its level. Pawns may change boards by one step; Rooks/Bishops/Kings/Queens may jump to any board up to their level, moving in their normal fashion. Vertical Moves are not restricted by square color.
  - Type caps and Phase‑change restrictions: You may not initiate any action that would cause a Phase Change into a type already at three on the boards, or that would reach three after counting all of your current emblem‑up actions that will complete into that type (these reserve a slot).

- Begin Ascend/Descend (2‑turn action)
  - Turn 1: Set the die so the piece emblem is up (emblem‑up) to begin Ascend/Descend.
  - Turn 2: The piece remains emblem‑up; you may Move a different piece.
  - Turn 3: If not broken, rotate the die to the new level and move the piece to the next board.
  - Color restriction (Pawn/Rook/Bishop only): The starting square for Ascend/Descend must match your color. King/Queen are exempt.
  - Prerequisites: The piece must be on a board equal to its current level, and it must not be Confused or Paralyzed.
  - Disruption (breaks the action while emblem‑up):
    - Safety Bubble: An opponent Moves into the piece’s movement pattern on that board (see Movement reference for specifics per piece).
    - Destination Square: An opponent occupies the exact destination square on the target board.
    - Destination‑Type Saturation (Phase Change only): If the action would Phase Change and your destination type no longer has an available slot under the cap of three (counting reserved slots), the action breaks immediately.
  - King/Queen exception: Their Ascend/Descend cannot be broken by Safety Bubble; Destination Square can still break it.
  - Final move exception: The final Ascend/Descend that removes a King (from Board 7) or a Queen (from Board 1) cannot be broken.
  - Limit: You may start at most one Ascend/Descend per turn.

- Forced Evolution (Special Action)
  - Once per game, on your turn you may immediately Phase Change one of your pieces in place (obey the cap of three and reservations). It retains its current level and must be able to act afterward. Then immediately perform one action with that piece only (Move or begin Ascend/Descend).
  - Safety valve: If you begin a turn with no legal Move and cannot begin Ascend/Descend with any piece, you may perform Forced Evolution even if you have already used your once‑per‑game use; in this case the chosen piece must be Paralyzed, and the Phase Change must remove its paralysis so it can act.

## 6. Movement and Range Reference
- Pawn (White): Moves one square orthogonally on its current board. Safety Bubble: the four orthogonal adjacent squares.
- Pawn (Black): Moves one square diagonally on its current board. Safety Bubble: the four diagonal adjacent squares.
- Rook (White): Moves any number of squares orthogonally on its current board. Safety Bubble: any square along orthogonal lines from the piece (rook‑lines).
- Bishop (Black): Moves any number of squares diagonally on its current board. Safety Bubble: any square along diagonal lines from the piece (bishop‑lines).
- King (White) / Queen (Black): Both move any number of squares orthogonally or diagonally on their current boards. Safety Bubble: any square along rook‑ or bishop‑lines from the piece.

Vertical Move uses the same movement patterns projected across boards up to the piece’s level (Pawns change boards by one step).

## 7. Influence States
- Confused: An opposing piece of equal or lower Phase occupies any square within the piece’s movement pattern on the same board. Effect: The piece may still Move (including Vertical Move up to its level) but cannot begin Ascend/Descend.
- Paralyzed: An opposing piece of higher Phase occupies any square within the piece’s movement pattern on the same board. Effect: The piece cannot Move or begin Ascend/Descend.
- Assist: A Confused or Paralyzed piece is freed if a friendly assisting piece is on any square within the piece’s movement pattern on the same board and is the same or higher Phase than the highest‑Phase blocking piece. Edge case: If two same‑Phase friendly pieces are within each other’s movement pattern and both are Confused by a same‑Phase opposing piece, either may start Ascend/Descend; however, only one Ascend/Descend may be started per turn, so the other remains Confused.

## 8. Piece Evolution
Advancing Phases: White progresses Pawn → Rook → King. Black progresses Pawn → Bishop → Queen.

Phase Change checks: You cannot initiate a Phase Change if you already have three of the destination type on the boards, or if you would reach three when counting all current emblem‑up actions that will complete into that destination type (these reserve a slot). During Ascend/Descend, if destination‑type saturation occurs, the action breaks immediately.

Level reset and starting numbers: Pawns begin at level 1 (White) or level 7 (Black). When a piece Phase Changes, replace its die with the new piece type and reset its level to base (White = 1; Black = 7). Exception: in Forced Evolution, the piece retains its current level.

## 9. End of Game
When a White King Ascends from Board 7 or a Black Queen Descends from Board 1, that piece is removed from the game. The first player to remove three pieces in this way wins. The final Ascend/Descend is unbreakable.

## 10. Quick Start
- Distribute dice; decide first player.
- Remember: total pool = 7; per‑type cap = 3; level shows highest board reached.
- First turns: place a Pawn (on your color); develop positions; protect emblem‑up pieces.
- Ascend/Descend: emblem‑up, wait, then move; safeguard Safety Bubble and Destination Square.
- Use Forced Evolution once per game for tempo or breakouts; safety‑valve exists if completely stuck.

## 11. Glossary
- Level: A piece’s highest board achieved; shown by the die’s upward number.
- Start Board: Board 1 for White; Board 7 for Black.
- Move / Vertical Move / Placement Move: Standard movement on‑board; board‑jumping up to level; placing a Pawn on your Start Board (on your color).
- Emblem‑up: Die face showing the piece emblem to mark an ongoing Ascend/Descend.
- Safety Bubble / Destination Square: Disruption triggers: presence within the piece’s movement pattern; occupation of the exact landing square.
- Confused / Paralyzed / Assist: Influence states and the cooperative unblocking by a friendly piece.
- Forced Evolution: Once‑per‑game in‑place Phase Change that retains level and acts immediately; also available as a safety‑valve when completely immobile.
