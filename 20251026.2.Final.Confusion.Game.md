* * ## Confusion — Game Ruleset: Final Recap
     
      Confusion is named after the in-game state **"Confused"**—a state of interference and distraction that shapes play.
    
      ### 1. The Game Setup
    
      * **Boards:** 7 boards, stacked vertically, each 7x7 squares. Boards are numbered 1 (Bottom) to 7 (Top).
      * **Pieces:** The boards begin empty. At any time, each player may have at most **3** of each of their piece types on the boards. `Pawn`s enter play via a Placement "Move" (see section 4).
      * **Total Pool:** Each player has **7** pieces for the entire game, including any `King`/`Queen` that has completed its final Ascend/Descend and been removed from the boards. Once your pool is exhausted, you cannot place additional `Pawn`s.

      ### 2. The Objective
    
      The first player to successfully complete the journey with **three** of their pieces wins the game.
    
      This winning move is achieved when a player's final-Phase piece completes its "Ascend" or "Descend" action from its final board.
    
      * **White (`King`):** Wins by successfully "Ascending" from **Board 7**.
      * **Black (`Queen`):** Wins by successfully "Descending" from **Board 1**.
    
      When a piece completes this final move, it is removed from the game.

      ### 3. The Asymmetrical Paths
    
      #### White Player
      * **Piece Path:** `Pawn` $\rightarrow$ `Rook` $\rightarrow$ `King`
      * **Start Board:** Board 1 (Bottom)
      * **Journey:** Moves **UP** the boards using the **"Ascend"** action.
    
      #### Black Player
      * **Piece Path:** `Pawn` $\rightarrow$ `Bishop` $\rightarrow$ `Queen`
      * **Start Board:** Board 7 (Top)
      * **Journey:** Moves **DOWN** the boards using the **"Descend"** action.
    
      ---
    
      ### 4. The "Move" Action (Movement & Interference)
      
      This is a 1-turn action to move a piece to a **vacant square**. "Move" actions are used for positioning, interference, or returning to the "path."
      
      #### Placement "Move" (Bringing Pawns into Play)
      * As a **"Move"**, you may place one of your `Pawn`s onto your **Start Board** (White: Board 1; Black: Board 7) on any vacant square, provided you currently have fewer than **3** `Pawn`s of your color on the boards.
      * This counts as your action for the turn.
      * The on-board limit is **3 of each piece type** per player (e.g., up to 3 `Pawn`s, and later up to 3 `Rook`s/`Bishop`s and 3 `King`s/`Queen`s).
      * **Pool check:** You may only place if you have not yet used all **7** pieces from your total pool (ascended `King`/`Queen` still count toward the pool).
      * **Color restriction:** Placement must be on a square that matches your side's color (White pieces on white squares; Black pieces on black squares).
      
      #### On-Board "Move"
      Movement on a piece's *current* board.
      * `Pawn` (White): Moves 1 square **orthogonally**.
      * `Pawn` (Black): Moves 1 square **diagonally**.
      * `Rook` (White): Moves any number of squares **orthogonally**.
      * `Bishop` (Black): Moves any number of squares **diagonally**.
      * `King` (White) & `Queen` (Black): Both move any number of squares **orthogonally or diagonally**.
      
      #### Vertical "Move" (Board-Jumping)
      Movement *between* boards.
      * A piece's **level** is the furthest board it has reached on its current journey (its "level of attainment").
      * A `Pawn` can "Move" **one board up or one board down**, but only to a board **up to (or at) its level.**
      * A `Rook`, `Bishop`, `King`, or `Queen` can "Move" by jumping vertically to any board **up to (or at) its level,** moving in its normal fashion.

      ### 5. The "Ascend" / "Descend" Action (The Journey)
      
      This is the **2-turn action** required to move along the main path from one board to the next.
      
      #### The Action
      * **Turn 1:** Set the die so the **piece emblem** face is **up** to begin "Ascend/Descend." This marks the piece as **ascending/descending**.
      * **Turn 2:** The piece remains **emblem-up**; you may **Move** a different piece normally.
      * **Turn 3:** If not **broken**, rotate the die so the new **level** number is up and move the piece to its destination square on the next board. If the action is **broken**, rotate the die back so the current **level** number is up; the piece remains on its original board.
      * **Color restriction (Pawn/Rook/Bishop only):** The **starting square** for Ascend/Descend must match your side's color. `King`/`Queen` are exempt from this restriction.
    
      #### Prerequisites (Conditions for Starting)
      A piece can only "Begin Ascend/Descend" if *all* of the following are true:
      1.  It is on the board **equal to its current level.**
      2.  It is **not "Confused"** (see section 6).
      3.  It is **not "Paralyzed"** (see section 6).
      
      #### Disruption (How to "Break" the Action)
      This 2-turn action is "broken" if, during either of the two opponent turns while the piece is **emblem-up** (ascending/descending), any of the following occur:
      1.  **Safety Bubble Disruption:** An opponent "Moves" into the piece's "safety bubble" *on that same board*. This bubble is defined by the piece's movement pattern:
          * **`Pawn`:** Is disrupted if an opponent moves into its **1-square "bubble"** (ortho for White, diag for Black).
          * **`Rook` / `Bishop`:** Is disrupted if an opponent moves onto any square within its **"movement pattern"** (Rook-lines for White, Bishop-lines for Black).
      2.  **Destination Square Disruption:** An opponent "Moves" one of their pieces onto the **destination square** (the exact square the piece would land on) on the target board.
      3.  **Destination-Type Saturation (Phase Change Only):** If this action would result in a **Phase Change** and, during the emblem-up interval, your **destination type** no longer has an available slot under the **cap of 3** (counting any reserved slots), the action is **broken** immediately.
      * **`King` / `Queen` Exception:** The "Ascend/Descend" action for a `King` or `Queen` **cannot** be broken by the "Safety Bubble Disruption." It *can* still be broken by the "Destination Square Disruption."
      * **Final Move Exception:** The final "Ascend/Descend" that removes a `King` (from Board 7) or a `Queen` (from Board 1) from the game **cannot be broken in any way.**

      ### 6. Conflict & Cooperation (Indirect Rules)
    
      Conflict is indirect, focusing on two different states of paralysis.
    
      #### "Confused" (Cannot "Ascend/Descend")
      This is a state of distraction caused by an *equal or lower-Phase* opposing piece.
      * **Rule:** A piece is **"Confused"** if an **opposing piece of equal or lower Phase** is on a square within its "movement pattern" *on the same board*.
      * **Effect:** A **"Confused"** piece **can still "Move"** (including Vertical "Move" up to its **level**), but it **cannot begin "Ascend/Descend."**
    
      #### "Paralyzed" (Cannot "Move" or "Ascend/Descend")
      This is a state of total paralysis caused by a *higher-Phase* opposing piece.
      * **Rule:** A piece is **"Paralyzed"** if an **opposing piece of a higher Phase** is on a square within its "movement pattern" *on the same board*.
      * **Effect:** A **"Paralyzed"** piece **cannot "Move" or "Ascend/Descend."** It is locked in place until the blocking piece moves away.
    
      #### Type Caps & Phase Changes
      * The per-type on-board cap of **3** applies at all times across all boards.
      * You **cannot initiate** any action that would cause a **Phase Change** into a destination type if:
        * You already have **3** of that type on the boards, or
        * You would reach **3** when counting all of your **currently emblem-up** Ascend/Descend actions that will complete into that destination type (these actions **reserve** a slot).
      * An emblem-up action that will change Phase **reserves** one destination-type slot until it completes or is broken. If that reservation cannot be maintained for any reason, the action is **broken** (see Disruption 3).
    
      #### "Assist" (Breaking Paralysis & Confusion)
      This is how friendly pieces cooperate to overcome these states.
      * **Rule:** A "Confused" or "Paralyzed" piece is *freed* (and can "Move" or "Ascend/Descend" normally) if there is a friendly **assisting** piece **on any square within the piece's movement pattern (on the same board).**
      * **Condition:** The assisting piece must be of the **same or higher Phase** than the **highest-Phase *blocking* piece.**
      * **Example:** A White `Pawn` is **"Paralyzed"** by a Black `Bishop` (Phase 2). A friendly White `Rook` (Phase 2) *can* act as an **assistant** because it is the same Phase as the blocking piece.
      * **Edge Case:** If two same-Phase friendly pieces are within each other's movement pattern and both are **"Confused"** by a same-Phase opposing piece, either friendly piece may start "Ascend/Descend" due to **assistance**. However, because you can only start one "Ascend/Descend" per turn, both cannot start at the same time; the other remains **"Confused"** until the board state changes.
     
      ---
     
      ### 7. Physical Components & Board
     
      #### Pieces (Dice-Based)
      Each piece is represented by a **d8 die**:
      * **Faces:** Numbers **1–7** on seven faces and a **piece emblem** on the remaining face. The **upward number** shows the piece's current **level** (its **level of attainment**) and thus the highest-numbered board it may freely reach with a Vertical "Move".
      * **Starting level:** `Pawn`s begin with the die showing **1** for White and **7** for Black.
      * **Per-Type Differentiation (3 dice of each type per player):**
        * **`Pawn` dice:** Body matches side color (**White** or **Black**); numbers in the **opposite** color.
        * **`Rook` / `Bishop` dice:** As above, plus a **contrasting edge/border** in the opposite color to distinguish Phase 2.
        * **`King` / `Queen` dice:** **Gold** body with numbers in the player's side color (White or Black).
      * **Phase changes (swapping dice):** When a piece advances in Phase (e.g., `Pawn` → `Rook`/`Bishop`; `Rook`/`Bishop` → `King`/`Queen`), replace its die with the corresponding type die and **reset its level** to the **base** for that path: **White = 1**, **Black = 7**. This prevents skipping ahead; each phase must traverse the boards again.
      * **Quantity:** Each player uses **9 dice total** (3 per piece type). The game's **total pool of 7 pieces** per player still applies; some dice may remain unused.
      * **Tracking:** Increase the die's upward number when the piece reaches a new highest board. A piece's **level** only **increases within its current Phase**; it **resets on Phase Change** (except where noted below).
      
      #### Forced Evolution (Special Action)
      A named special action that instantly changes a piece's Phase in place and then lets it act:
      * **Effect:** **Choose one of your pieces**, immediately **Phase Change in place** (obeying the **cap of 3** and any reserved slots). The piece **retains its current level number** (no reset). It must be a piece that would be **able to Move** after the change. Then **immediately perform one action with that piece only** (either a normal **Move** or begin **Ascend/Descend**).
      * **Once per game:** Each player may use **1 Forced Evolution** at any time on their turn.
      * **Safety valve:** If at the start of your turn you have **no legal Move** and **cannot begin Ascend/Descend** with any piece, you may perform **Forced Evolution** even if you have already used your once-per-game use; in this case the **chosen piece must be Paralyzed**, and the Phase Change must **remove its paralysis** so it can act.
     
      #### Boards (7 x 7)
      * **Pattern:** Standard checkered pattern with orientation: **all four corner squares are black**, and the **cardinal edge centers** are **white**. The exact **center square** is **gold**, matching the `King`/`Queen` dice.
      * **Mounting:** Boards connect to a **central pillar via a side/edge connection** (not through the center square), offset in space to reduce stacking awkwardness.
      * **Coordinates:** Columns **A–G** (files) and rows **1–7** (ranks) marked on each board. Suggested notation may include the board index with square (e.g., **1a7 → 2a7**). **Calling** (announcing) a move aloud is good etiquette but **not required**, and moves need not be written down.
